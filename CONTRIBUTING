## üìù Entry Format

Each entry should follow this exact format:

```markdown
- [YourGitHubUsername](link-to-your-solution) - Brief description of your approach/focus
```

### ‚úÖ Good Examples:
```markdown
- [alice_smith](https://github.com/alice_smith/ai-judge-fairness) - Bias detection in legal AI using LIME interpretability
- [bob_jones](https://github.com/bob_jones/autonomous-drone-swarm) - Multi-agent coordination for search and rescue operations
- [charlie_dev](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ABC123) - Jupyter notebook exploring transformer attention mechanisms
```

### ‚ùå Bad Examples:
```markdown
- [My Project](https://github.com/user/repo) - AI stuff
- alice_smith - https://github.com/alice_smith/project (missing link formatting)
- [alice_smith](https://github.com/alice_smith/project) (missing description)
```

## üéØ What to Include

### Acceptable Link Types:
- **GitHub repositories** (preferred)
- **Jupyter notebooks** (Google Colab, GitHub, etc.)
- **Live demos** (Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces, etc.)
- **Documentation sites** (GitHub Pages, personal sites)
- **Research papers** (ArXiv, institutional repositories)

### Description Guidelines:
- **15-80 characters** recommended
- Highlight your **unique approach** or **key contribution**
- Mention **specific techniques** or **technologies** used
- Be **concise** but **informative**

### Examples by Case Type:
- **ü§ñ Autonomous Agents**: "Multi-agent reinforcement learning in Unity environment"
- **üîç RAG Time**: "Vector database optimization using Pinecone and LangChain"
- **üé® Creative AI Studio**: "Style transfer for architectural visualization using GANs"

## üìê Formatting Rules

### 1. Alphabetical Ordering
- Entries must be in **alphabetical order** by GitHub username
- Use lowercase for sorting (e.g., "Alice_Smith" comes before "bob_jones")
- Check existing entries to find the correct position

### 2. Markdown Syntax
- Use proper markdown link syntax: `[text](url)`
- Ensure all links work and point to public repositories/resources
- No HTML tags or complex formatting

### 3. Case Section Placement
- Add your entry under the correct case section
- Each case has its own dedicated section with emoji header
- Don't create new sections or modify existing headers

## üîç Before You Submit

### Pre-Submission Checklist:
- [ ] Your link works and points to a public resource
- [ ] You've included a meaningful description
- [ ] Your entry is in alphabetical order by username
- [ ] You're contributing to the correct case section
- [ ] Your repository/resource contains substantial work (not just a placeholder)
- [ ] You've followed the exact format specified above

### Content Quality Standards:
- **Substantial Implementation**: Your contribution should demonstrate significant effort and learning
- **Clear Documentation**: Include a README explaining your approach
- **Working Code**: If applicable, ensure your code runs and produces results
- **Ethical Considerations**: Respect privacy, fairness, and responsible AI practices

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong Case Section**: Make sure you're adding to the correct research case
2. **Broken Links**: Test your links before submitting
3. **Missing Description**: Every entry needs a brief description
4. **Wrong Alphabetical Position**: Check the ordering carefully
5. **Private Repositories**: Ensure your linked resources are publicly accessible
6. **Placeholder Content**: Don't submit empty or minimal implementations
